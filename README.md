## ðŸ§© Module Overview

Here's a quick explanation of all the modules and libraries used in this project:

| Import | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `random` | Standard Python module for generating random numbers. |
| `nethack_map_generator` | Custom module for generating NetHack-style dungeon maps. Make sure this file is in the same directory. |
| `bot_pathfinding` | Custom pathfinding logic for bots navigating the map. |
| `glfw` | Library for creating windows and handling input in OpenGL contexts. |
| `OpenGL.GL` | Core OpenGL functions for rendering. |
| `OpenGL.GLU` | OpenGL Utility Library for projections and camera transformations. |
| `OpenGL.GLUT` | OpenGL Utility Toolkit for windowing and utility functions (often used for prototyping). |
| `numpy` | Powerful numerical operations and array handling. |
| `glm` | OpenGL Mathematics library (Python port), used for vectors, matrices, and transformations. |
| `PIL.Image` | Part of Pillow, used for image loading and texture handling. |
| `math` | Standard mathematical functions like sin, cos, and sqrt. |
| `ctypes` | Interfacing with C-style data types, useful when passing data to OpenGL. |
| `sys` | Access to system-specific parameters and functions (e.g., command-line args). |
| `time` | Time measurement utilities, often used for frame timing. |
| `collections.deque` | Double-ended queue for fast FIFO/LIFO operations, useful in pathfinding or input buffering. |
